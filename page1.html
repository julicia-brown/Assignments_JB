    <h2>Things we've learned so far:</h2>
    <ol type="I">
      <li>Semantic Tags</li>
        <ol type="i"> 
          <li id="odd"> Semantic Tags are HTML tags that are used not for function but for logical structures.</li>
          <li>Semantic Tags are often used to define the parts of a webpae and often used to assign them their distinct looks. </li>
          <li id="odd">Without CSS these tags will not affect the look of your page. They greatly help with organizing your code too!</li>
        </ol>
      <li>Cascading Stylesheets (CSS)</li>
        <ol type="i"> 
          <li>Cascading stylesheets also known as CSS is used to define what out HTML should look like using a set of rules. These rules work similar to if/then statements we're used to in everyday life.</li>
          <li id="odd">There are three ways to implement CSS into your HTML. In line which goes into the line of each code. Embedded which goes into a style tag on your HTML coding page and lastly as a separate CSS file which then is linked. </li>
          <li>The reason why it is called casacading is becaus eof how browsers will read this style sheets. They read in a trickle down cascading method where the inline style or default style will always take precedents if what is in the CSS sheet is not applicable. </li>
        </ol>
      <li>CSS Box Model</li>
        <ol type="i"> 
          <li id="odd">Many if not all HTMLM elements can be thought of as boxes. This is how many browsers think of them and function.</li>
          <li>There are different parts of your box ,odel that you can control using css for it's design and structure.</li>
          <li id="odd"> With this box you can design where on your page an element sits and what that element looks like among the others.</li>
